*Elevate your Discord community with **Yumiko** - a versatile and multifunctional bot!*

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

### üî® Step 1: 

If you do not already have a Discord account, sign up [here](https://discord.com/register).

Create an application on [**Discord Developer Portal**](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

- Under `Discord Developer Portal > Applications`, click `New Application`and assign a `Name`.
- Under `Discord Developer Portal > Settings > General Information`, assign a `Description`, and `App Icon` for your application.

### üî® Step 2:

Obtain your **Discord token** by:
- Navigate to the `Discord Developer Portal > Settings > Bot.`
- Under `Username`, there should be a `Reset Token` button.
- Before resetting, scroll down to `Privileged Gateway Intents`
- Assign the bot `MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT` (and `SERVER MEMBERS INTENT` if you choose to).
- Click `Reset Token` and complete 2FA if it is enabled on your Discord account.
- Copy your Discord token or come back to this step as we will need this in [Step 6](https://github.com/jntm7/discord-chatbot-catto?tab=readme-ov-file#step-6). 

### üî® Step 3:

Invite your bot to desired Discord server using the **OAuth2 URL Generator**:
- Navigate to `Discord Developer Portal > Settings > OAuth2`.
- Under `OAuth2 URL Generator`, assign the `bot` scope.
- Under `Bot Permissions`, assign the bot **all the text permissions**, as well as **connect, speak under voice permissions**.

### üî® Step 4:

**Clone this repository** with your preferred version control platform (e.g. GitHub Desktop), or simply **download [build](build)** and place it to your preferred directory.

Ensure that you have Python installed. You can download it from the [**Python official website**](https://www.python.org/downloads/). During installation, check the option to `add Python to system PATH`.

### üî® Step 5:

Before running the program, users will need to install the required dependencies found in [**requirements.txt**](build/requirements.txt)

To do this:
- Navigate to the directory you extracted or clone the repository.
- Open a terminal or command prompt. This can be done by pressing `Win + R` then typing `cmd`.
- Assuming you have Python installed from the last step, enter ```pip install -r requirements.txt```. This will install the dependencies necessary for the features of this application.

### üî® Step 6:

Retrieve your Discord token from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) that we set up in [Step 2](#step-2).

Open the [.env file](build/.env) with a text editor (e.g. Notepad) and copy this Discord key after `DISCORD_TOKEN`.

Keep this token secure and refrain from sharing it. 

However, you can always reset the token, just remember to replace the `DISCORD_TOKEN` value in the [.env file](build/.env).

### üî® Step 7:

Run [**main.py**](build/main.py) in IDE or code editor of your choice (e.g. VSCode) to launch the bot.

If there are no errors:
- `"YOURBOTNAME is now running!"` should be shown in the terminal.
- Your bot should appear as online in your Discord server.

### üî® Step 8:

To interact with the bot:
- In any channel within the invited server where the bot is present, type [commands to interact with it](#current-bot-commands).
- Your typed message should be replicated in the terminal in the format `[channel] user: "message"`.

Things to note:
- As this is a local operation, you must keep the terminal instance running to keep the bot working. 
- To stop, simply terminate the command prompt or terminal. Your bot will appear as offline in Discord after a while.

## ü§ñ Current Bot Commands:

### üëã Greetings

- `hello`
- `how are you`
- `help` - to prompt the bot to list all its available commands
